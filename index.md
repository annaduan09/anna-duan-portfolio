### Predictive Modeling and Machine Learning Using R

[**Predicting Arrest Risk in Chicago**](/file/AnnaDuan_Predictive-Policing_MUSA508.html)
Bingchu Chen and I created this model to predict future arrest risk in Chicago, Illinois. Our goal is to identify communities are projected to experience a high incidence of arrests and allocate social services to these  hot-spots.

[**Allocating Home Repair Subsidies**](/file/HomeRepairSubsidy.html)
Bingchu Chen and I made this algorithm to help the Department of Housing and Community Development(HCD) allocate marketing resources for a home repair tax credit program. Using this algorithm, HCD can identify the homeowners most likely to take the credit and increase theirs and their neighbors' home values.

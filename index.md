# Predictive Modeling and Machine Learning Using R

[**Predicting Arrest Risk in Chicago**](/file/AnnaDuan_Predictive-Policing_MUSA508.html)  
[Bingchu Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bingchu-chen-bb772a1a6/) and I created this model to predict future arrest risk in Chicago, Illinois. Our goal is to identify communities which are projected to experience a high incidence of arrests and allocate social services to these  hot-spots.

[**Estimating Home Sale Prices in Miami**](/file/PANDA_Midterm.html)  
[Bingchu Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bingchu-chen-bb772a1a6/) and I designed this model to predict home sales prices in Miami and Miami Beach, Florida.

[**Allocating Home Repair Subsidies**](/file/HomeRepairSubsidy.html)  
[Bingchu Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bingchu-chen-bb772a1a6/) and I made this algorithm to help the Department of Housing and Community Development(HCD) allocate marketing resources for a home repair tax credit program. Using this algorithm, HCD can identify the homeowners most likely to take the credit and increase theirs and their neighbors' home values.

**Philadelphia Older Adults' Senior Center Access via Transit** 
In this paper which I co-authored with Shengxiao (Alex) Li, Haoyu Hu, and Tony Smith, we examine older adults' time-varying accessibility to Philadelphia senior centers via public transit. We also compare accessibility across census tracts and demographics. We will present this research at the [International Association for China Planning Annual Conference](http://www.china-planning.org/alpha/annual-conference-2020/) and the [Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting](http://www.trb.org/AnnualMeeting/AnnualMeeting.aspx) this winter.

# Other Writing

- [Journalism](https://www.thedp.com/staff/anna-duan)  
I reported for Penn's independent student newspaper, The Daily Pennsylvanian, for one year, focusing on research and politics stories.
- [Centering Equity in Transportation Planning](https://www.metroplanning.org/news/8913/Mobility-is-Justice-Centering-equity-in-transportation-planning)
- [Is COVID-19 the End of Cities?](https://urban.sas.upenn.edu/future-cities-blog-post-urban-studies-2020-gordon-fellows)  
Over the summer of 2020, I was one of 5 [Jacques Gordon Fellows](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/improving-quality-life-urban-cities) who received a stipend to pursue an internship around improving the quality of life in cities. At the end of the summer, as a reflection piece, my fellowship cohort co-authored an article about our thoughts on COVID-19 and the future of cities. 
- [Recidivism Prediction Memo](/file/recidMemo) 
In this memo, I recommend that the City of Chicago adopt a new algorithm to use for allocating spots in an ex-offender job training program. I address algorithmic fairness concerns and advocate for the financial and societal benefits of identifying ex-offenders at high risk of recidivism to allow into the program.
